## 1. Information We Collect

### Automatically Collected Information

When you use the App, we may automatically collect:

- Device information (e.g., operating system, device type).
- Usage data (e.g., pages visited, time spent in the App, session duration).
- Approximate location (if enabled, for potential future features; currently not used for personalization).
- Internet Protocol (IP) address.

We do **not** collect precise geolocation data.

### User-Provided Information

To use certain features (e.g., account creation, chatbot), you may provide:

- Email address.
- Password.
- Display name.
- User ID (UID).
- Google Sign-In data (if using Google login).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- To provide and maintain App features (e.g., chatbot responses with context, exercises).
- To improve the App and analyze usage trends (anonymized and aggregated data only).

- For security and fraud prevention.

We do **not** use your data for advertising, marketing promotions, or training AI models.

## 3. AI Chatbot and Third-Party Processing (Google Gemini)

The App's chatbot is powered by the Google Gemini API.

- Your chat inputs (prompts) and generated responses are sent to Google's servers for real-time processing.
- Recent conversation history is stored by us for context across sessions.
- Google's handling of transmitted data is governed by their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Gemini API Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms).
- **Important**: Do not share highly sensitive personal information (e.g., health details, financial data) in chats, as inputs are transmitted to Google. The App is not intended for medical or therapeutic use.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App uses third-party services with their own privacy policies:

- Google Play Services / Firebase (for analytics, authentication): [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- Google Gemini API: [Gemini Additional Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms)

We may share anonymized, aggregated data with trusted providers for App improvement. We do not sell personal data.

## 5. Data Disclosure

We may disclose information:

- To comply with legal requirements.
- To protect rights, safety, or investigate fraud.
- With service providers bound by confidentiality.

## 6. Data Security

We use reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information. However, no method is 100% secure.

## 7. Data Retention

- Account data: Retained while your account is active.
- Upon account deletion (via Settings): All personal data, including full chat history, is permanently deleted.
